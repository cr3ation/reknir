# Nginx configuration directory

This directory contains:
- nginx.conf: Main reverse proxy configuration
- ssl/: SSL certificates (if using traditional setup with self-signed certs)

For Cloudflare Tunnel setup, SSL is handled by Cloudflare.
For traditional setup, you can use Let's Encrypt or Cloudflare Origin Certificates.
