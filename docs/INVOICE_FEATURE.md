# Invoice Management Feature - Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2024-12-22 (Updated)
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Version**: 1.2.0

## Overview

Complete invoice management system for Swedish bookkeeping with automatic verification creation for both outgoing (customer) and incoming (supplier) invoices.

## Features Implemented

### 📤 Outgoing Invoices (Kundfakturor)

**Customer Management**:

**Invoice Workflow**:
1. **Draft** → Create invoice
2. **Send** → Automatic verification created:
   ```
   Debit:  1510 Kundfordringar (Customer receivables)
   Credit: 3xxx Revenue accounts (per line)

## Business Logic

### Automatic Verification Creation

**Service Layer** (`app/services/invoice_service.py`):
- `create_invoice_verification()` - Outgoing invoice posting
- `create_invoice_payment_verification()` - Outgoing payment
- `create_supplier_invoice_verification()` - Incoming invoice posting
- `create_supplier_invoice_payment_verification()` - Incoming payment

**Key Features**:
- Automatic account lookup (1510, 2440, 2640, 26xx)
- VAT splitting by rate
- Account balance updates
- Error handling for missing accounts

### VAT Handling

**Output VAT (Outgoing Invoices)**:
- Automatic mapping to correct VAT accounts:
  - 25% → 2611 (Utgående moms 25%)
  - 12% → 2612 (Utgående moms 12%)
  - 6% → 2613 (Utgående moms 6%)

**Input VAT (Supplier Invoices)**:
- All input VAT → 2640 (Ingående moms)
- Deductible from output VAT

### Accounting Basis Support

**Accrual Method (Faktureringsmetoden)**:
- Invoice verification created when invoice is sent
- Payment verification created when payment is received

**Cash Method (Kontantmetoden)**:
- No verification on send (only marks invoice as sent)
- Single verification created on payment (revenue + VAT booked at payment time)

## Frontend Integration

**Pages**:
- `/invoices` - Main invoice list with tabs for customer and supplier invoices
- `/invoices/:id` - Customer invoice detail view
- `/supplier-invoices/:id` - Supplier invoice detail view

**Navigation**: Added "Fakturor" menu item

**Features**:
- List view for outgoing invoices with fiscal year filtering
- List view for supplier invoices with fiscal year filtering
- Invoice creation modal with full form (customer, dates, lines, VAT)
- Supplier invoice creation modal
- Invoice detail views with line items and summary
- Status badges with color coding (draft=gray, sent=blue, paid=green, partial=yellow, overdue=red)
- Overdue highlighting (red background for past-due invoices)
- Swedish currency formatting
- Send invoice confirmation modal (with accounting basis info)
- Register supplier invoice confirmation modal
- Payment marking modal with date picker
- PDF download button for customer invoices
- Attachment upload/download for supplier invoices

**API Integration**:
- TypeScript types for all invoice entities
- Complete API client methods
- Error handling with Swedish messages

## Swedish Accounting Compliance

✅ **Proper Account Usage**:
- 1510 Kundfordringar (Customer receivables)
- 2440 Leverantörsskulder (Accounts payable)
- 2640 Ingående moms (Input VAT)
- 2611-2613 Utgående moms (Output VAT)
- 3xxx Revenue accounts
- 6xxx Expense accounts

✅ **Double-Entry Bookkeeping**:
- All automatic verifications balance
- Debit = Credit enforced

✅ **Audit Trail**:
- Links to verification IDs
- Timestamps on all changes
- Cannot modify paid invoices

## Example Workflow

### Creating and Paying an Outgoing Invoice

**1. Create Customer**:
```bash
POST /api/customers/
{
  "company_id": 1,
  "name": "Acme AB",
  "org_number": "556677-8899",
  "payment_terms_days": 30
}
```

**2. Create Invoice**:
```bash
POST /api/invoices/
{
  "company_id": 1,
  "customer_id": 1,
  "invoice_date": "2024-11-09",
  "due_date": "2024-12-09",
  "invoice_lines": [
    {
      "description": "Consulting services",
      "quantity": 10,
      "unit": "tim",
      "unit_price": 1000,
      "vat_rate": 25,
      "account_id": 20  // Account 3000 (Revenue)
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result**: Invoice draft created with total 12,500 SEK (10,000 + 2,500 VAT)

**3. Send Invoice**:
```bash
POST /api/invoices/1/send
```

**Result**: Verification created automatically:
```
Ver A-1  2024-11-09  Faktura F1 - Acme AB
  1510  Kundfordringar              12,500  (Debit)
  3000  Försäljning                          10,000  (Credit)
  2611  Utgående moms 25%                     2,500  (Credit)
```

**4. Mark as Paid**:
```bash
POST /api/invoices/1/mark-paid
{
  "paid_date": "2024-12-09"
}
```

**Result**: Payment verification created:
```
Ver A-2  2024-12-09  Betalning faktura F1 - Acme AB
  1930  Företagskonto              12,500  (Debit)
  1510  Kundfordringar                      12,500  (Credit)
```

## Testing

**API Testing**:
- All endpoints documented in FastAPI /docs
- Test via Swagger UI at http://localhost:8000/docs

**Required Accounts** (from BAS import):
- 1510 Kundfordringar
- 1930 Företagskonto
- 2440 Leverantörsskulder
- 2611 Utgående moms 25%
- 2612 Utgående moms 12%
- 2613 Utgående moms 6%
- 2640 Ingående moms
- 3000 Försäljning (or other 3xxx)

## Performance Notes

- Invoice numbering uses database queries (could be optimized with sequences)
- Verification creation is transactional (atomic)
- Account balance updates happen inline (consider async for scale)
- No caching implemented yet

## Known Limitations

- No email sending (invoices must be downloaded as PDF and sent manually)
- No recurring invoices
- No credit invoices (kreditfaktura)
- No invoice templates/presets
- No OCR for supplier invoices (manual entry required)
- Overdue status is calculated in frontend only (not persisted in database)

## Success Metrics

✅ Create and track customer invoices
✅ Automatic accounting entries on invoice send
✅ Payment tracking with automatic entries
✅ Supplier invoice management
✅ VAT calculation and tracking
✅ Full API coverage
✅ TypeScript types and API client
✅ PDF generation and download

## Migration

Run database migration:
```bash
docker-compose exec backend alembic upgrade head
```
